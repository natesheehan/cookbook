From the crowded tenements of the East End to the bustling ports of Liverpool, tales of foreign-born carriers of the pestilence strike terror into the hearts of patriotic Britons.\nWith each passing day, the ranks of the afflicted swell, casting a shadow of uncertainty over our beloved land. Many attribute the rapid spread of the disease to the unchecked flow of migrants, whose unsanitary habits and alien customs are believed to harbor the seeds of contagion.\nFrom the trenches of war-torn Europe to the teeming shores of our imperial dominions, the specter of the Spanish Flu looms large, claiming lives with ruthless efficiency. Yet, amidst the carnage, let us not forget the role played by those whose foreign origins mark them as vectors of disease.\nIn the face of this dire threat, it falls upon us, the defenders of hearth and home, to safeguard our nation from the insidious influence of foreign contagion. Let us close our borders to the hordes of the infected and preserve the purity of our race from the ravages of this foreign scourge."}
